Hi ! This is the first datadisk for Siriel 3.5. You can find here 12 levels with 3 soundtracks. I think that the 5th level - Don't drink the water is the most dificult....  Some greetinx: Oozy ( Your school database is real good. ), TRAMP ( What do you meen about FOLK - CFT 97 ? ), Asystech ( Good luck with KORHEL DRAW. ), LAGUNAsoft ( Where are you ? ), Expa and Paradion ( I have no messages from you. What are you doing ?! ), Marx ( Heya, what da hack ya net ? ), Jozo ( Searching for photos.... Not found ! ), Jurou ( Do you still want to upgrade your computer ? ), Wlado ( Good co-operator. ), Iwa ( Yes sir ! In deed. ), Marsel ( I'm disagree ! Why are you of afraid playing C&C with me and Jurou ), Miso Z. ( Heya what da ya meen abou thisa crazya game ? ), Mamut ( You write real looooooong emajls ), Miso U. ( I don't know, what can I say. ). So, that was greetinx for my computer friends and now somebody else: Zolo, Silvia, Katuska, Zuzanka, Yuaya, Miso S, Milka, Tondo, Zuzana, Skrecok ( I'm sorry of S ), Lubka S., Sisa, Maja ( Never see you again ? ), Peto, Ondro, Ada, Slniecko , Safo, Fero, Balu, people from T.O.B.O. and K.T.O. ... So, that's all folks of greetinx.    Are you still on-line ?   Yes ? That's good. I want to say some words about how I create Siriel 3.5. It was X-mas 1992. One of gifts for me was 8bits computer DIDAKTIK M - compactibil with Speccy. For next one year I was creating some easy programms, like Hello world. Than I created easy game SIRIEL 1. You move with small figure and use some objects. After this masterpiece I creadet the second part of this game SIRIEL 2. I forgot say, what was the inspiration. It were games from CODE MASTERS - DIZZY 1, 2, 3, 3.5, 4, 5, 6, 7. If you know this game, you know that figure is little egg called DIZZY. Your goal is save his girl-friend DAISY. In my game you control little tomato, but your goal is escape from the farm of bad goblin. Than it was about spring of year 1997, I created PC version of Siriel 1. I think that it was shit. In the winter I recreated the second part - SIRIEL II. It was real better, there were animations from 3D studio and soundtrack of SUMMER 69. In the summer 1998 I created Siriel 3 - it was something else, becasuse in the first and the second part you saw Siriel from the top, now you can see him from the profil. But I created only small version - there were too many mistakes in program. In the autum I corrected this mistakes and I created editor for maps. So and now you can see my final work. . . .  If you want to create your own datadisk write me and I send you my editor with description - How to create DATADISK.     ? ?    Are you still reading ?????   Yes ?  Do you think that this is the end of this scroll ???           Ha - ha! NO ! This scroll will continue, becasue I can use 4096 bytes for it and now I used only 2860 bytes.      Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm......  Long thinking - What can I write ?      So, I'm sorry of my strange english, but it'll be better.       Ho-ho, what da cute lilow hacky slang. I wana send greeting to Tsumonu and Mitschnik... Hello - greeting form Slovakia - No Slovenia !.... .... .. .          This is the end of the end, my only friend the end... (DOORS)      ;-)      At zije Franta !!  Jesli ma z ceho. :-D          The koniec   ...    XX:-D ...     LOOOP
